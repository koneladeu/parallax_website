      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>If you're not already familiar with parallax images then the best way to 
        understand them is to view one, take a look at the parallax image featured in this
         tutorial from José Julián Londoño Calle. Parallax images are made up of up to 6 
         layers. When a user moves their mouse over the image, the layers each move at 
         different speeds along the X, Y, or Z axis in order to create the illusion of 
         each layer being a different distance from the camera. In this tutorial we're 
         going to show how you can generate parallax images from existing artwork to give
          them a new dimension.</p>
    
      <h2>What makes a good parallax image?</h2>
      <p>In our experience almost any image can be made into a parallax image, but some
         definitely work better than others:
        <ul>
          <li>Images with features at 2 or more distinct distances from the camera make the most of the parallax effect</li>
          <li>With the exception of the background layer all the other layers in a parallax image need some transparent pixels to allow layers below them to be seen. Images that have been flattened can be difficult to work with as each layer has to be painstakingly cutout. Picking an image where you still have access to manipulate (hide and show) layers or a 3D render where you're able to render each layer separately is an easier option</li>
          <li>To allow the layers within the image to move you need the layers to be larger in size than the viewport you define, how much larger depends on the amount of movement, so make sure you pick an image large enough to accommodate your viewport and desired movement</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Use a container element and add a background image to the container with a 
        specific height. Then use the background-attachment: fixed to create the actual
         parallax effect. The other background properties are used to center and scale 
         the image perfectly:</p>
